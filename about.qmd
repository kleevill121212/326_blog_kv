# Reflecting on Mini Projects 1-5

Over this semester, the mini-projects in this course offered more than just practice; it was a very nice opportunity to test out some of the concepts that we learned in the note packets and labs. With each project, I found that I was challenging myself to actually understand the concepts rather than the classic plug-and-chug method of mathematics that I was used to. Although some projects were harder for me to wrap my head around than others, I found that each of them forced me to think criticallty about the material that I covered throughout the semester, which ultimately reinforced my understanding.

Each project tied back directly to a specific section of the course. The first mini-project on sampling distributions gave me a clearer sense of how skew and shape influence statistics like Ymin and Ymax. It was a really solid refresher on some of the concepts that I had seen back during COVID when I took Stat 113. Thinking about skewedness, in comparison to symmetric distributions and how it affects Ymin and Ymax was a clarifying experience. It was very interesting to see how drastically standard error could vary as well, depending on the distribution. In Mini Project 2, I got into my storytelling bag, but it was the fact that I had to refresh my knowledge on concepts that lay the foundation for statistics, which truly made it a fun project. That project helped bring terms from the Estimation section to life and made the whole idea of an estimator feel less abstract by applying it to a story that I created.

Mini Project 3, which focused on confidence intervals and coverage rates, was a turning point, mainly because I struggled with it. The simulation setup was clear, but interpreting the results in a way that felt intuitive was not easy for me. We wanted to see how well our 90% confidence intervals actually hit the true proportion, across various sample sizes and population parameters. But even with that structure, I found myself unsure of how to reason through the result. The Confidence Intervals note packet had shown us how the pivot method works, and touched on how asymptotic behavior stabilizes as n gets large, but applying that to varying widths and interpreting coverage rates across different p-values was just hard to wrap my head around. I could calculate everything, but it didn’t feel like I had a strong intuition. With that being said, I feel that revisiting the concepts in Mini Project 3 now makes a lot more sense; it just challenged me at the time. Struggling through this Mini Project really propelled me to work harder at the ones to come.

Mini Project 4 was where things got more exciting than what we had previously covered, so I have to say that I agree that an entire course could be taught on Bayes. The Bayesian framework felt logical to me, and the way we layered priors with actual match data made the process feel more personalized than any other project. The Bayesian Analysis section helped solidify how to pick prior parameters using either previous data (like Nadal’s past performance) or subjective belief (like the announcer’s claim). It was cool to see how different priors gave us different posteriors and how that played out both numerically and graphically. I especially liked the way the R code gave us the shape of the full posterior distribution, instead of just a point estimate. Being able to visualize the results made it much easier to understand. Pulling on some probability skills allowed for an intuitive interpretation of these images. Despite Bayes being more of a unique section in the course, I felt that it connected the dots for me in terms of understanding the essence of the frequentist framework that we see elsewhere. 

Lastly was Mini Project 5, which was probably the most thought-provoking for me. After covering a good portion of the Hypothesis Testing section, this project pushed me to reconsider how we use p-values and what we mean when we call something ‘significant.’ I got to engage with the philosophy of testing, like understanding how you might want to construct a test based on the specific scenario. Thinking about how statistics is not just numbers made me connect to ideas like this, where the numbers mean something. The situational tradeoff between Type I and Type II errors got driven home for me when I did this project. The project forced a good bit of introspection pertaining to my own research, which I felt was very rewarding. Talking about p-values, something that gets introduced in high school level stats, will inevitably be connected to almost all other sections in the course. It was thought-provoking to consider when it is ‘ok’ to use it heavily, and when it isn’t. It also seemed strange to be hopping back into using p-values so heavily after completing this one. 

There was a pretty clear progression through most of the Mini Projects, especially with Mini Projects 1-3. First, understand variability; then estimate; then build intervals around those estimates. Mini Project 4 and Mini Project 5 felt as if they stood on their own. Mini Project 4 focused on updating beliefs through prior information and posterior probabilities, while Mini Project 5 asked me to interpret the evidence in context. I was convinced pretty well that you should not just draw the line at .05. Now that I’ve completed all five, I’d say my biggest takeaway is that statistics isn’t just about arriving at numbers, it’s about constructing an argument and letting the numbers tell the story. You can calculate a mean or construct a confidence interval, but unless you understand what assumptions you’re making and what those results actually say about the world, it does not deliver. What I gained from these projects was a way of thinking that asks better questions. I started the semester by focusing on more technical concepts, similar to the calculation-heavy teaching style of past Math-Stat courses. Overall, I saw where my understanding was solid, where it needed work, and developed a great toolkit to take with me moving forward.
